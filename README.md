## Description

Sometimes, mistakes are inevitable. Whether conducted by stupidity, shame, a desire to belong, or anger, they happen and so, one must bear the consequences. More often though, life's consequences are strange and seemingly irrelevant. Hardly coherent enough to learn any lesson. [Insert a name] made a mistake. Now, they find themselves in the employ of a gremlin a few inches short of two feet, but says they are because of the point of their giant ears, wearing an oversized robe with many pockets who has a maze to traverse. The contract has been signed in blood. 

Get ready. Kibakhan commands you.

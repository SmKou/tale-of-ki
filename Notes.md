## Artefacts

**Blood of the Virgin**: Appears as a crystallized pool of blood in the shape of a uterus, held in the hands by the virgin sacrifice, bled dry and preserved.

**Seal of God**: A stained glass ceiling of a library forming the seal of god, composed of two concentric circles, a pentagram, and three heptagons, inscribed with the name of god and the angels.

**Eye of Horus**: Preserved left eye and skull of a renowned scholar who studied god and the angels.

**Cave of the Angels**: Underground network of caverns beneath a lake with extensive rock formations and pools, where large spiders spin taut webs. Water constantly drips from the ceiling, vibrating the webs like stringed instruments and plopping in pools of varying size from varying heights. Where the entrances have caved in, hollow tree trunks extend from the outside in and when the wind blows, there comes the sound of wind pipes.
